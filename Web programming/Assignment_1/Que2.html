			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few actors as impactful as Irrfan Khan. Showcasing an impeccable range of performances, Irrfan has time and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again given us memorable characters, 
			each one more unique than the other.
			From Haasil to Pan Singh Tomar, Maqbool to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lunchbox and Piku to Madaari, when it comes to Irrfan's repertoire of movies,words truly fall short. 
			However, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrfan's popularity can't just be attributed to his acting alone. 
			A self-admittedly hesitant 'star', Irrfan holds a tremendously &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mature view of cinema, art and the world we live in. 
			He may have spent over two decades in front of the camera but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never for once has he lost touch with the person he was before he came under the spotlight.
